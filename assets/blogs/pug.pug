p Probably due to my system administration experience, Javascript took a while to <em>click</em>. My code training started humbly - the mathematics curriculum required just a single semester studying Java (very <b>not</b> javascript, despite the name). The rest of my academic tenure relied on software like MatLab, Maple, and RStudio, never to return to its humble, coffee-inspired beginnings<sup>1</sup>. Then, discovering linux guided me down a learning path of backend engineering - I'd scoff at any software that didn't offer a CLI tool of some kind.
  
p A recent, albeit brief, contracting experience opened my eyes to future. No longer shall fullstack engineers be required to be multilingual. Knowledge flows when humans can communicate more effectively, and Node.js manages to bridge the perpetual gap between frontend and backend engineering. 
  
p Buuuuuuuuuut, my needs are simple, and nobody writes websites with raw HTML anymore. I sounded the alarm, and #[a(href="https://pugjs.org") Pug] came to my rescue. The HTML preprocessor, once called Jade, offers a more simple alternative to HTML syntax, and I find the experience pleasant. While Pug offers #[a(href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it") markdown filter], the native featureset was too powerful to justify adding yet another dependency to <code>package.json</code>.
  
p #[a(href="https://glitch.com/") Glitch] gave me the inspiration to dive into the Node.js ecosystem and the tools to swim, rather than sink, in the ocean of JS. For those looking to tell their stories on the internet during COVID-19, the internet never disappoints to provide options (or memes, but I digress).
  
p Check out the source code itself - Pug has suited me well as a quick-and-dirty markup language, with the added bonus of some programming horsepower under the hood. #[a(href="//github.com/kodumbeats/blog") (source)]
  
p.footnote <sup>1</sup> The author fondly remembers the abundantly-flowing coffee during his undergraduate studies. He does not remember, however, returning to compiled programming languages.
