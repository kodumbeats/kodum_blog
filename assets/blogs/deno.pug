p Those in the Node.js world have been closely eyeing #[a(href="https://deno.land/") deno] to learn the future of the secure-by-default js/ts runtime from none other than Ryan Dahl<sup>1</sup>, the creator of Node.js himself. 

p As a syadmin, the project goals resonate strongly with me: deno ships as a single binary, scripts have no access to the filesystem or networking by default, and the CLI tool includes some quality-of-life utilities like code formatting.

p I wanted an environment to try out this new engine, but by default, Glitch only runs Node.js projects. After some trial-and-error (plus some help from geniuses in the community), I was able to implement deno in Glitch as a full Node.js replacement. The third-party plugin #[a(href="https://github.com/l2ig/aqua") Aqua] felt very Express.js-esque, which enabled me to implement a basic web server in seconds: #[a(href="//glitch.com/edit/#!/deno-kodumbeats") (source)]

p.footnote <sup>1</sup> His #[a(href="https://deno.land/v1") announcement post] is worth a read, especially the discussion of Deno's current limitations.
