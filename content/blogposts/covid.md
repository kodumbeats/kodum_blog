As one humankind, we are struggling to find our new normal, riding the waves of the internet in novel ways to solve critical problems. I'm no virologist, but I do have plenty of computers about my house, and an tenet that we all have a role to play in the world. I decided to donate my spare resources to a better cause: [Foldingathome](https://foldingathome.org/), an old friend of mine (since the PlayStation 3 era, at least).

Foldingathome is a distributed computing platform that allows computer owners to donate their spare CPU time to scientific research. I participated in protein folding calculations in the past, and now the team is using the same tech to find answers for SARS-CoV-2. However, tech has come a long way since the launch of the PlayStation 3.

Since the "before-times" ended, I've been learning and developing software to _simplify serverless_ for [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org) deployments. I chose to build infrastructure on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), the behemoth of container orchestration, due to its limitless deployment options. That means I've got a development Kubernetes cluster that isn't near efficient capacity. Thanks to the genius of the [open source community](https://github.com/richstokes/k8s-fah), I was able to donate some of my spare space in the hopes that science and technology unite to find the answers we so desperately need.

If Kubernetes has a chance to help the world, I'm willing to try it.
