I'm a huge fan of minimalism in today's webtech, especially when it reduces bundle sizes. I banish buttons and info bars in lieu of hotkeys and tiling window managers (<3 i3). Browsers have been my bane, until now.

[Min](https://minbrowser.org/) is an open-source browser build in [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). Having a full browser just to power a single-page webapp is, in my opinion, usually excessive, despite Electron's conveniences. However, it cleverly makes a great environment for building a new browser, using the same stack (HTML/CSS/JS) that the pages themselves render upon request.

The [source code](https://github.com/minbrowser/min) is published under the Apache open source license. I'm currently maintaining Min with the rest of the collabs on github, and I also host the most up-to-date [build scripts](https://github.com/kodumbeats/min-archlinux) for arch linux - I'm currently driving [manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) every day.
