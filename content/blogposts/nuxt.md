The discovery of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) marked the beginning of my journey through frontend development. I could build websites using a file structure that made sense: a template section for HTML, script section for JS, and style for CSS. Though, as a lazy developer, I cringed at the repetition of typing the same component name in multiple places, in multiple files (read: multiple bugs).

Displeased, I searched for a more elegant solution and discovered [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/). Automatic routing, file-level component imports, and static-site generation was more than enough for me to jump ship and explore. `micro pages/newpage.vue` [^1] becomes `http://localhost:3000/newpage` automagically. Aww yiss.

With relative ease, I was able to fully recreate [this blog](https://github.com/kodumbeats/blog) without Express.js or any server-side logic. Banished to the annals of history are the days of frontend-phobia. Welcome are the days of new, exciting adventure. But I could take less frequent CSS debugging sessions.

Coming soon: I actually create a CMS for these posts.
